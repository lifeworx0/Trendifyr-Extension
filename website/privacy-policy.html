            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Trendifyr ("we," "our," or "the Extension") is a Chrome extension designed to help users track and analyze visual content trends across websites. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the data you provide while using Trendifyr. By installing and using Trendifyr, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not use the extension.</p>

            <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>Trendifyr collects only the necessary data to provide its functionality. Trendifyr collects the following data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Images, Videos, GIFs</strong> We analyze and collect the URLs and basic metadata of images, videos, and GIFs found on websites you visit. This helps us track trending content types across the web.</li>
                <li><strong>Icons:</strong> We detect and collect information about icons (e.g., social media icons, logos) used on web pages. This assists in tracking trends in iconography.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We may collect publicly available user-generated content such as comments, posts, or reviews from websites you visit to track trends in user engagement.</li>  
                <li><strong>Metadata and Context::</strong> We may collect basic metadata related to content, such as file formats (e.g., .jpg, .mp4), video platforms (e.g., YouTube), and content type (e.g., image, video, GIF).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> Trendifyr does not collect any personal data, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>

                <li><strong>Financial or Payment Information:</strong> We do not collect any financial information, such as credit card numbers or transaction details.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> We do not collect passwords, credentials, or security-related information.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect location data, such as GPS coordinates, IP addresses, or other location-based information.</li>
                <li><strong>Web History:</strong> We do not track your entire web history, only content related to the active tab you're currently browsing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>The data collected by Trendifyr is used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track and analyze visual content trends across websites.</li>
                <li>Provide insights into popular visual content types.</li>
                <li>Improve the functionality and performance of the extension.</li>
                <li>Enhance user experience by offering relevant and up-to-date content trends.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Permissions and Datab Usage</h2>
            <ul>  
            <li><strong>ActiveTab Permission</strong> The extension uses the activeTab permission to interact with the active tab in your browser. This allows us to access and analyze the visual content on the currently viewed webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>Host Permissions</strong> Trendifyr requires host permissions to access the content on webpages you visit. This enables us to collect visual content data from those websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Scripting</strong> We use scripting permissions to run the extension's code on the webpages you visit, which allows us to detect and analyze visual content trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage</strong> The extension uses local storage to save data about trends over time, helping us provide you with insights and track changes in content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Data related to visual content trends is stored locally on your device and is used only within the extension to provide real-time insights. The extension does not collect or store any data on remote servers. Data retention is limited to what is necessary for functionality and is deleted if the extension is uninstalled or the data is no longer needed.</p>

            <h2>Your Privacy Choices</h2>
            <p> You have control over the data the extension collects. You can disable certain features of the extension or uninstall it from your browser at any time. If you uninstall the extension, all data stored locally will be deleted.</p>

            <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we update the policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of the page. If any material changes are made, we will notify users by updating the extension description or through a notification within the extension itself.</p>
